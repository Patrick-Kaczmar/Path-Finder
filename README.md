## Description
This is a full stack app built off the google maps api to allow users to get nearby search results for activities using the users geolocation. You are able to click any of the results in the side bar to get the information relevant to that search, and also the gps directions will show you the optimal route. It displays the name of the place, the address, the opening hours, a photo of the place and your current weather data using the open weather api.
